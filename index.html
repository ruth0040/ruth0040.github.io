      <h1>Logic Meets Creative</h1>

      <p class="left-p"><span>Hey-o!</span> Coding, coding, coding. Many designers cringe at the logical and very
        technical side to making a website or application. Not me. Off the start of
        every project I bounce in my seat, excited to be telling the computer how to
        act.  Since being a child I have always been a very diverse person in my likes,
        polar opposites actually. Being at home in math class as well as in art, weird right?</p>

      <p class="right-p">Not me. I thrive in environments where I can solve problems in creative
        and logical ways. Graphic Design (to me) is that happy medium, combining the
        left and the right brain at the same time and engaging them both equally.
        This is why I am a designer.</p>
